It does not correctly reflect the current CPU usage. (this is also a problem with linux `ps` utility)\n\nBut If you call `usage.lookup()` continuously for a given pid, you can turn on **keepHistory** flag and you'll get the CPU usage since last time you track the usage. This reflects the current CPU usage. \n\nsee following example to enable keepHistory flag\n\n~~~js\nvar pid = process.pid;\nvar options = { keepHistory: true }\nusage.lookup(pid, options, function(err, result) {\n\t\n});\n~~~\n\nyou can clear history cache too\n~~~js\nusage.clearHistory(pid); //clear history for the given pid\nusage.clearHistory(); //clean history for all pids\n~~~\n\n## Motivation\n\n* Some of the NodeJS PAAS providers do not expose an interface to monitor CPU and Memory usage.\n* They asks us to go for somewhere else for that which I don't want to go (or simply I cannot go)\n* So `node-usage` was born to tackle on this.\n",
